@Proof @bc_wallet @Story_29
Feature: Proof
   In order to easily prove my credential details to a verifier
   As a holder
   I want to be able to review, accept, and decline a proof request


   @T001-Proof @critical @AcceptanceTest @Story_29
   Scenario: Holder receives and views the contents of a proof request
      Given the User has completed on-boarding
      And the User has accepted the Terms and Conditions
      And a PIN has been set up with "369369"
      And the Holder has selected to use biometrics to unlock BC Wallet
      And a connection has been successfully made
      And the holder has a Non-Revocable credential
         | issuer_agent_type | credential_name                           |
         | AATHIssuer        | Default AATH Issuer Credential Definition |
      When the Holder scans the QR code sent by the "verifier"
      And the Holder is taken to the Connecting Screen/modal
      And the Connecting completes successfully
      And the Holder receives a proof request
      Then holder is brought to the proof request
      And they can view the contents of the proof request
